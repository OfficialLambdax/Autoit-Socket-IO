### Code sharing

This is a demonstration of how your client and server can share exactly the same codes and functions but have different roles, this is how games did "hosted games" before, today everything is more or less serverhosted.

#### Setup
* Compile and run server.exe
* Compile and run client.exe as many times as you want
